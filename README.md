# BayesianEgineCPP
Bayesian engine with a command line made with C++

### Project done during my time at UPC
#### Course: Computer Science Topics

During this course I develop a Bayesian Network Engine in C++ that have this features:

- DAG detector
- I/0 Management
- Quality Metrics: Akaike, Entropy, MLP
- Command Line interface

For this course we develop two different articles(university project articles, not published) that uses our engine.

- Prediction of World Cup Russia 2018 matches using Bayesian Networks(Spanish)
- Student approach to computational time with bayesian networks (Spanish)

Both papers can be found at: https://github.com/GaEsRaRe/papers/tree/master/Papers
